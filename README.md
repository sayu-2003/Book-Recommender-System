In this project, Collaborative Filtering has been used.
In Collaborative Filtering, we tend to find similar users and recommend what similar users like. In this type of recommendation system, we donâ€™t use the features of the item to recommend it, rather we classify the users into clusters of similar types and recommend each user according to the preference of its cluster.
The content-based recommender systems have limited use cases and have higher time complexity. Also, it is based on some limited content but that is not the case in Collaborative Filtering based algorithms. One of the main advantages that these recommender systems have is that they are highly efficient in providing personalized content but also able to adapt to changing user preferences.
